# Week7 assignment - full stack app in react - Game tracker

## What worked well

### Requirments

- I made a very clear wireframe that I used throught my project, which will be kept in the screenshot folder in the REPO
- Client is built in React
- I used express to create my server and it has both Get and Post endpoints
- I used a react form so I can add games to my game tracker
- I have 2 pages in my app, the home page that displays currently playing games and then my game tracker table which displays all games
- I have my database in supabase with dummydata inserted into it
- All data is displayed in the table and filtered data is displayed on the home screen
- .map is used to create the table and the home page
- interval and useeffect polls my database every 60 seconds
- I used branches thoughout the development so I could get more use to that process

### Stretch goals

- I can delete table content and there is a delete confirmation beforehand as well
- The ongoing games are filtered onto the homescreen

## Even Better if

- I had a bit of trouble styling my table, I got it looking decent but the individual table rows or columns were being tough to sort out
- Im not sure what i could of added to make a second table and add relations between them. I thought about using steams api to get my hours directly from my account but I think thats a major stretch goal for the future
- Same with updating data, I think I will wait for a future demo to see how thats done more clearly first
- the menu popup being in the table container meant it was a bit annoying to just fix onto the screen
- I need to use comments more
